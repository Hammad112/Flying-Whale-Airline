# Power BI Visualization Tips:

This Power BI project aims to address three key business scenarios:

## 1. Flight Activity Analysis:

- Analyze monthly and yearly flight booking patterns.
  - **Tips:**
    - Ensure proper naming and sorting of months.
  - Explore the correlation between flight distances and loyalty points accumulated.
    - Include a trend line and a max line.
  - Assess the impact of companion bookings on loyalty points redeemed.
    - Determine the number of companions where members are redeeming the most points.

## 2. Loyalty Segmentation:

- Segment customers based on loyalty card status.
  - Show the total number of flights by Loyalty Card across months.
  - Analyze the demographics and behaviors of customers.
    - Depict the number of loyalty members by marital status.
    - Show flights booked by loyalty card and broken up by gender.
    - Show median distance traveled by different loyalty card tiers.
  - Utilize the Narrative visual to auto-generate insights. Ensure to remove irrelevant insights.
  - Identify trends in Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) across loyalty segments.
    - Answer: Which credit card tier on average has customers with the highest Customer Lifetime Value?

## 3. Enrollment and Cancellation Trends:

- Analyze the reasons and patterns behind membership cancellations.
  - **Tips:**
    - Create a table Customer Loyalty Cancellation for loyalty members that have canceled.
    - Create two new columns in the new table: Enrollment Duration (e.g., 2 years 1 month) and Enrollment Duration (Months) (e.g., 25).
    - Create two new columns in Customer Loyalty History table: Enrollment Duration (Till Date) and Enrollment Duration (Till Date) Months. These columns should count the time a member has been enrolled till today or till they canceled, whichever comes first.
  - Provide information for the average duration of enrollment among canceled members by province. Which province sees members canceling the fastest? (Bonus: Depict this information on a map)
  - Determine the most popular months for cancellations.
  - Analyze cancellations by education and marital status. Which demographic is canceling the most?
  - Identify which loyalty card members have the lowest enrollment duration among cancellations.
- Recommend strategies for improving enrollment and retention.

This structured approach outlines the key tasks and objectives for each business scenario, providing a clear roadmap for data analysis and visualization in Power BI.
